# About Me
- Primarily a researcher in Computer Vision , with specific interests in answering these questions:
    - Does knowing the topology of datasets help solve Variational Inference and Manifold Learning tasks?
    - Do non-euclidean spaces hold the key to better representing real world downstream vision tasks?
    
# Ultimate Research Goal : AI for Social Good

Other than this, I have previously worked at Indian Space Research Organisation and Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata where I worked on Microwave Image Processing and Hyperspectral Deep Learning respectively.

In my free time , I read about Biblical mythology and Philosophy and an ardent fan of Nietzsche and Albert Camus.

## Research Papers
- **[Topo Sampler: A Topology Constrained Noise Sampling for GANs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OTxZfmVFlTO)** accepted as a **spotlight** presentation for NeurIPS 2020 Workshop TDA and Beyond. [Link to poster](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=OTxZfmVFlTO&name=Poster) [Link to NeurIPS talk](https://slideslive.com/38941572/topo-sampler-a-topology-constrained-noise-sampling-for-gans)
## Software
- **[Spotify Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine)** is a music recommender system based on matrix factorization techniques (arguably) used by the Spotify Team (just not scaled up like theirs is). This is a work in progress project and has garnered some interests at Open Source programs. If you want to contribute , feel free to open an issue or comment below any of the existing ones.
