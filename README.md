"In science, self-satisfaction is death. Personal self-satisfaction is the death of the scientist. Collective self-satisfaction is the death of the research. It is restlessness, anxiety, dissatisfaction, agony of mind that nourish science."
 -- _Jacques-Lucien Monod_

# About Me
- Primarily a researcher in Computer Vision , with specific interests in answering these questions:
    - Does knowing the topology of datasets help solve Variational Inference and Manifold Learning tasks?
    - Do non-euclidean spaces hold the key to better representing real world downstream vision tasks?
    
## News
- Accepted an invitation to be Program Committee member of LatinX in AI for ICML 2021.
- My new blogpost on [THE GEOMETRY OF DEEP GENERATIVE IMAGE MODELS AND ITS APPLICATIONS](https://ucalyptus.me/posts/2021/05/blog-post-2/)

## Research Papers
- **[Topo Sampler: A Topology Constrained Noise Sampling for GANs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OTxZfmVFlTO)** accepted as a **spotlight** presentation for NeurIPS 2020 Workshop TDA and Beyond. [Link to poster](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=OTxZfmVFlTO&name=Poster) | [Link to NeurIPS talk](https://slideslive.com/38941572/topo-sampler-a-topology-constrained-noise-sampling-for-gans)
## Software
- **[Spotify Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/ucalyptus/Spotify-Recommendation-Engine)** is a music recommender system based on matrix factorization techniques (arguably) used by the Spotify Team (just not scaled up like theirs is). This is a work in progress project and has garnered some interests at Open Source programs. If you want to contribute , feel free to open an issue or comment below any of the existing ones.
