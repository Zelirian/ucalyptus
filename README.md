# About Me
- Currently working as a research associate at CVPR Unit , ISI Kolkata on intersection of Remote Sensing and Deep Learning.
- Particularly interested in Optimization,Algebraic Geometry,Generative Modeling and 3D Vision.
- Other than research, I also do AI freelancing on various platforms.
- I am very active on Github where I contribute to popular organizations like Pytorch or Tensorflow or I create meaningful softwares from scratch.
- Occasionally I conduct workshops in conferences and hackathons.
- I also mentor students or fellow scholars in Software Engineering,Artificial Intelligence or MLOps.
- _NEW_: Doing Academic Service as a reviewer for IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters.
